# DBM-P1


Decremental Bipartite Matching implementation


## Idea of implementation

- First create the structure for the Bipartite Graph with all the utilities:
    - [ ] Graph Structure
    - [ ] Adding/Deleting Nodes + Edges
    - [ ] Go through the Graph 
- Matching Algorithm Implementation that returns the matching to check
-
