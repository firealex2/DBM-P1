# DBM-P1


Decremental Bipartite Matching implementation -- Documentation Follows soon


Makefile needs that testfiles exist in the same directory.

Running the gen_graphs will generate the tests input : graph + removals

running the main will generate logs + csv files that are to be used later on in the python scripts.


I moved my tests into separate folders for better organization.

Refining/Documenting the code is still in progress.
